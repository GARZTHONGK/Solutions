Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

Initial situation:

All attributes have the starting value 0.

Rules:
If sleepiness, thirst or hunger goes above 100, Morris the miner dies.

When your program is complete, push it to your github repository.
Then send this Teams message to your teacher: <filename> done
Thereafter go on with the next file.
